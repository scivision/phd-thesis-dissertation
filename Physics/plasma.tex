\section{Planetary Plasma}
Plasma about planetary bodies are infused with magnetic fields. 
For those planetary bodies without intrinsic magnetic fields, crustal magnetic fields such as at Mars and induced magnetic fields caused by the magnetic field lines draping around the planetary body nonetheless are essential to describing particle behavior.
Comets also experience an induced magnetosphere, as confirmed by \textit{in situ} measurements \citep{israelevich1994}.
Although diagrams of the geomagnetic system lend themselves to complexity, the basic particle behavior can be described starting with Newton's Second Law of Motion.
