\section{Digital All-Sky Camera (DASC)}
The DASC instrument has a $360^\circ$ azimuthal view at elevations from horizon to local geographic zenith at $512 \times 512$ pixel resolution. 
When interpreting DASC images, unwarping using \citet{geodata} shows video on the computer screen as it would appear to a human observer looking at the sky, helping eliminate the massive barrel distortion inherent to all-sky images.
On 14 APR 2013, DASC took an image at each of $\lambda \in \lbrace 427.8, 557.5, 630.0 \rbrace$~nm approximately every \unit[13]{s}.
Previous work has combined the three image channels into a pseudo-RGB image, but the issue of temporal aliasing is noted for dispersive auroral events, since each color channel is obtained with about \unit[4]{s} spacing.
%We present the DASC images in three columns by wavelength.
Note that the HiST instrument by design highly attenuates \unit[557.7]{nm} and \unit[630.0]{nm} emissions, while the prompt \unit[427.8]{nm} emission is one of the primary emissions observed by HiST.
