\section{Purpose}
The primary science purpose of the dissertation research is to use meticulous and systematic observational evidence to clarify the physical connections between Alfvénic auroral morphologies and ionospheric turbulence that produces coherent ISR backscatter.
The dissertation work resulted in a multi-station synchronized observatory recording auroral video at \unit[20]{ms} cadence.
As described in section~\ref{sec:fuspfisr} and chapter~\ref{chapter:sim}, this cadence is adequate for detecting and characterizing the associations between Langmuir turbulence and Alfvénic aurora.

Plasma traveling throughout the solar system and bound to planetary bodies is constantly subjected to changing magnetic field configurations and bulk flows.
A streaming instability results when a locally strong flow of particles (current), such as electronic precipitation into the ionosphere, causes longitudinal waves in the background plasma. 
Under frequently occurring conditions, the plasma wave grows exponentially into a streaming instability.
The ionospheric turbulence creates signatures readily detected by sufficiently fast sampling ISR and synchronized camera systems, allowing distinction between various types of Alfvén wave-sourced perturbations and characterization based on remote sensing inversion algorithms as developed in chapters~\ref{chapter:sim} and \ref{chapter:fusion}.

Each important aspect of the sensing system design and implementation is described to allow reproduction of the experimental apparatus and build confidence in the character of its output products.
Section~\ref{sec:aurorabasic} introduces key facets of optical auroral observation and processing advanced by the dissertation, expanded upon in chapter~\ref{chapter:inst}.
Section~\ref{sec:isrbasic} introduces connections between ISR and HiST optical observations and inversion, expanded upon in chapter~\ref{chapter:fusion}.
The necessary algorithms created to detect Alfvénic aurora and ion-acoustic turbulence seen in radar are introduced in section~\ref{sec:intdiscrim} and described in chapter~\ref{chapter:discrim} with additional applications showing the generality of the technique in appendices~\ref{chapter:marsis} and \ref{chapter:passive}.
