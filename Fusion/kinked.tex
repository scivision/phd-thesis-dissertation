\subsection{Kinked auroral arc}\label{sec:kink}
Auroral arcs with folds or kinks originate with magnetospheric configurations that are non-dispersive in nature.
Such disturbances also drive auroral vortices and vortex streets.
A striking example of a kinked auroral arc is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:20130414T0826}.

A substorm is indicated as the initiator of the perturbation based on the southward turning IMF reflected in sharp negative excursion at 08:25 UTC as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mag0826}.

A likely driver for this arc structure is an inverted-V acceleration region.
%As observed with HiST the auroral spectrum including the lines of Figure~\ref{fig:msp0826} is passed through the HiST BG3 filter, yielding $I_{557.7} \sim 0.01 \times I_{427.8}$.
The $I_{427.8}$ intensity suggests monoenergetic several keV electron beam configuration.

Monoenergetic inverted-V accelerated electron differential number flux in the several keV range is the most likely candidate for generating this kinked aurora.
