\section{Results}\label{sec:fusana}

Discrete auroral drivers can be broadly divided into quasi-static inverted-V structures and Alfvén waves (AW).
AW-driven auroral forms include splitting auroral arcs and flaming aurora.
Discrete auroral arcs driven by sources other than dispersive Alfvén waves include kinked auroral arcs and non-flaming, non-splitting discrete arcs.
HiST can distinguish between the differential number flux precipitation signatures responsible for AW and non-AW aurora.

Inverted-V potential drops have several associated mechanisms that can lead to fast time-dependent behavior such an intensity modulation.
Inverted-V auroral features do not have dispersive energy behaviors associated with them--precipitating particles across a range of energies arrive at roughly the same time $\Delta t \ll \unit[10]{ms}$ difference.
Double layers, and series of double layers may exist within an inverted-V structure giving rise to narrower width auroral arcs.

AW are associated with reconfiguration of the magnetosphere--particularly during the breakup and expansion phase of substorms, where a quarter-trillion watts are launched towards Earth \citep{mottez2015}.
AW are integral to the settling out of the system after a change in current flux.
The conditions favorable for DAW aurora are delineated in Figure~\ref{fig:alfvenblock}.

A key ground-observable characteristic of Alfvénic aurora is narrow arc width.
``Width'' describes spatial scale size in the dimension perpendicular to geomagnetic field $B$.
\citet{maggsdavis1968} noted that the lower observed limit of \unit[70]{m} arc width was instrumentally limited.
\citet{borovsky1993} noted that observations from contemporary ground-based auroral arc measurements continued to reveal arc widths less than \unit[100]{m}.
Alfvénic aurora are associated with a sudden large increase in flux of particles accelerated from a few eV to as much as \unit[10]{keV} \citep{chaston2003}.
Due to dispersion along the accelerated particle path, over several hundred milliseconds \citep{dahlgren2013} the characteristic energy $E_0$ will go from order \unit[10]{keV} to order \unit[100]{eV}.
A representative differential number flux for a DAW event is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:alfvenflux}.

    In this plot, overall flux $Q_0$ is held constant.}

\textit{In situ} Freja measurements with \unit[32]{kHz} sampling rate \citep{stasiewicz2000} consistently showed plasma evacuations by roughly a factor of two near magnetic perturbations along $B_\parallel$ consistent with the presence of Alfvén waves.
Considering the \unit[7]{km/s} platform motion, the spectrograms of magnetic field point to $k_\perp \in [10,7000]$~m.
Freja also observed clear correlations \citep{stasiewicz2000} with turbulent magnetic field and suprathermal electron bursts ranging from \unit[100]{eV} to \unit[20]{keV} with particle fluxes of order 100 times over the background, and Poynting flux of $\unit[1..20]{mW/m^2}$.

The sampling cadence configuration of PFISR and the optical instruments for each experiment is given in Table~\ref{tab:cadence}.
These raw sample times are far faster than the minute cadence typically employed for plasma parameter estimation, yet those minute-long estimates break down in the face of these transient events.
We examine four types of events in turn: auroral breakup, splitting auroral arc, flaming auroral arc, and kinked arc with joint analysis of optical, spectral and radar features.
