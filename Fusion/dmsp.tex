\subsection{PFRR Digital Meridian Scanning Photometer (PDMSP)}\label{sec:pdmsp}
P-DMSP collects a six-wavelength view of intensity vs. elevation and time along the local magnetic meridian.
The meridional intensity is measured for wavelengths $\lambda \in \lbrace 427.8, 486.1, 520.0, 557.7, 630.0, 670.0 \rbrace$~nm.
The typical measurement cadence is 14 seconds, so this measurement is contextual and secondary to the primary HiST and PFISR measurements \citep{meridianreader}.
Although HiST cadence is nearly three orders of magnitude faster than P-DMSP, the spectrometer nonetheless provides temporally smeared spectral context over a wide elevation range.
A future deployment of HiST is expected to include an EMCCD-based spectrograph operating at a comparable frame rate to the full-frame HiST EMCCD imagers.
