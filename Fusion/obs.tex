%\citet{akbari2012} discussed Langmuir turbulence using low-level radar data using a single high-speed EMCCD camera.
%\citet{dahlgren2013} gave relative estimates of flaming auroral behavior with an EMCCD camera and PFISR-based starting assumptions.
Fast EMCCD camera observations with ISR routinely show thin, highly dynamic aurora with temporal signatures characteristic of DAW aurora.
Shear plasma flows such as occur during reconnection launch Alfvén waves of wavenumber short enough to be seen in $\sim$ 10 degree field of view (FOV) cameras focused on a region about magnetic zenith.
During active solar times, substorms occur frequently enough that multiple Alfvénic aurora may be observed in a single night.
The following subsections describe the instruments and methods used to distinguish inverted-V aurora from the Alfvénic aurora associated with NEIALs.
