    abstract={GEOScan is a proposed space-based facility of globally networked instruments that will provide revolutionary, massively dense global geosciences observations. Major scientific research projects are typically conducted using two approaches: community facilities, and investigator lead focused missions. While science from space is almost exclusively conducted within the mission model, GEOScan is a new concept designed as a constellation facility from space utilizing a suite of space-based sensors that optimizes the scientific value across the greatest number of scientific disciplines in the earth and geosciences, while constraining cost and accommodation related parameters. Our grassroots design processes target questions that have not, and will not be answered until simultaneous global measurements are made. The relatively small size, mass, and power of the GEOScan instruments make them an ideal candidate for a hosted payload aboard a global constellation of communication satellites, such as the Iridium NEXT's 66-satellite constellation. This paper will focus on the design and planning components of this new type of heterogeneous, multi-node facility concept, such as: costing, design for manufacture, science synergy, and operations of this non-traditional mission concept. We will demonstrate that this mission design concept has distinct advantages over traditional monolithic satellite missions for a number of scientific measurement priorities and data products due to the constellation configuration, scaled manufacturing and facility model.},

    abstract = {Ion acoustic waves, similar to those detected by the Helios spacecraft from 0.3 to 1.0 AU, have now been detected by the Voyager spacecraft in the solar wind out to heliocentric radial distances of 1.7 AU. High bit rate waveform measurements provide the first high resolution, frequency-time spectrograms of these waves. The Voyager spectrograms show that the ion acoustic waves consist of narrowband bursts which last for a few seconds or less. The center frequency of the bursts can fluctuate rapidly in frequency, usually in the range between the electron and ion plasma frequency fp− and fp+ (These waves have been previously referred to as fp+ <f <fp− noise.) Comparisons of the high-resolution spectrograms from the Voyager spacecraft with similar measurements from earth-orbiting spacecraft show that spectra of the ion acoustic waves in the solar wind at 1.7 AU are identical to spectra of short wavelength ion-acoustic waves detected upstream of the earth's magnetosphere. The latter waves have been associated with protons streaming into the solar wind from the bow shock. This close similarity suggests that the ion acoustic waves detected in the solar wind by Helios and Voyager may be driven by an ion beam instability, as has recently been suggested in a theoretical analysis by Gary.},

Implementation is to be accomplished in two steps, called Phase 1 and Phase 2, each of which requires changes to both the Galileo spacecraft software and to the supporting ground systems.

    abstract={Spacecraft for deep space come in a variety of sizes as befits their missions, from the large, flagship-class spacecraft such as Cassini or Galileo to smaller craft such as New Horizons (Pluto) or Lunar and Martian landers classified by NASA as Discovery or New Frontiers missions. All missions are constrained in mass, power, or cost, or frequently all three. A communications system that reduces demands on these resources enables, for example, either increased science return (by devoting more resources to the payload) or more such missions to be flown (by helping to meet critical mass or power margins). In this paper, we review the evolution and current capabilities of deep-space transponders and transceivers, noting the differences that lend themselves to particular classes of missions. We report on the development of a flexible, low-power, low-cost, deep-space transceiver architecture for competed mission sets such as Discovery, Mars Scout, and New Frontiers, one that possesses unique communications and radio science capabilities. This state-of-the-art transceiver architecture leverages from high-performance commercial integrated circuit technology and frequency synthesis and digital signal-processing techniques, lending itself to integration, miniaturization, and further power reduction. A transceiver based on this architecture, developed for the space-borne New Horizons spacecraft's primary communications link and uplink radio science experiment, is reviewed in this paper. We conclude discussion of the modern deep-space transceiver architecture with a description of near-term and long-term future functional and performance communications and radio science enhancements to the transceiver.},

The ionospheric scatterers studied by Jicamarca are not spatially homogeneous and not beam filling in some cases, and distinguishing the bearing of the radar backscatter is essential for correctly interpreting the radar data as well as for discovery research. Both incoherent and coherent scatter from thermal and nonthermal plasma density irregularities, respectively, are strong functions of magnetic aspect angle. Radar interferometry can be used to discriminate the arrival angle or brightness distribution of the backscatter and, in the case of coherent scatter from field-aligned irregularities, determine its aspect sensitivity. Using multiple spaced receivers, the entire brightness distribution can be estimated from the measured visibility using aperture synthesis imaging techniques. This is the most incisive remote sensing tool available for studying ionospheric plasma irregularities and the instabilities that produce them. Fi-nally, a novel technique for antenna compression introduced at Jicamarca can be used to synthesize very broad radiation patterns that nevertheless make use of the entire Jicamarca phased array for transmission.},

This letter introduces a new Gaussian mixture parameter estimator (GMPE)-based framework to incorporate prior knowledge into this process. The GMPE makes possible a versatile model for parameter estimation under all conditions without compromising accuracy. Observations from dual-polarized and dual-frequency radar sensors can be utilized in the GMPE in a very flexible manner. Simulation examples have demonstrated that the GMPE has better estimation error performance than traditional methods for parameter estimation applications, particularly for noisy observations. The impacts of mixture number and state vector selections in the GMPE are also discussed.},

    abstract="Early auroral observations recorded in various oriental histories are examined in order to search for examples of strictly simultaneous and indisputably independent observations of the aurora borealis from spatially separated sites in East Asia. In the period up to AD 1700, only five examples have been found of two or more oriental auroral observations from separate sites on the same night. These occurred during the nights of AD 1101 January 31, AD 1138 October 6, AD 1363 July 30, AD 1582 March 8 and AD 1653 March 2. The independent historical evidence describing observations of mid-latitude auroral displays at more than one site in East Asia on the same night provides virtually incontrovertible proof that auroral displays actually occurred on these five special occasions. This conclusion is corroborated by the good level of agreement between the detailed auroral descriptions recorded in the different oriental histories, which furnish essentially compatible information on both the colour (or colours) of each auroral display and its approximate position in the sky. In addition, the occurrence of auroral displays in Europe within two days of auroral displays in East Asia, on two (possibly three) out of these five special occasions, suggests that a substantial number of the mid-latitude auroral displays recorded in the oriental histories are associated with intense geomagnetic storms.",

	title = {Influences of meteoric aerosol particles on the lower ionosphere},
	month = {December},
	abstract = {The Earth atmosphere is subject to a permanent bombardment by meteoroids which are supposed to inject extraterrestrial material into the Earth atmosphere in the order of 10 to 100 t per day when they evaporate between 80 and 110 km. The evaporated material reacts with the ambient atmosphere and recondensates into new nanometer-sized aerosol particles, so called Meteoric Smoke Particles (MSPs).  
	The layer of MSPs coincides with the D-region ionosphere of the Earth. Here, MSPs are subject to different kinds of charging processes. Among these are, for example, the attachment of free electrons or ions to the surface of MSP and the photodetachment of electrons from negatively charged MSPs. Even secondary electron emission induced by energetic electron precipitation from within the magnetosphere is possible at polar latitudes.
	
	The aim of this thesis is to investigate how these  charging processes of MSPs change the nature of the background D-region. Recent in-situ studies of the nighttime charge balance of the D-region indicate negatively charged MSPs to play a significant role. These experiments have been the starting point for modeling studies of not only the D-region charge balance but also the overall  ion chemistry of the D-region. This has been accomplished by implementing a MSP size distribution for a altitude region between 50 and 100 km into the ion reaction scheme of the Sodankyl{\"a} Ion and Neutral Chemistry (SIC) model. The results show, that especially the influence of MSPs on the electron density is important to characterize the D-region ion composition. During nighttime, electrons are effectively attached to the surface of MSPs resulting in reduced electron-ion recombination. Thus, the main loss process of positive water cluster ions nearly vanishes and these ions can grow to higher numbers of water ligands and also increase in number density. The capture of ions by MSPs is  a significant loss process for long-lived ions only.  During daytime, solar photons effectively photodetach electrons from the negatively charged MSPs. This results in a lower abundance of negatively charged MSPs during sunlit conditions.
	When investigating the diurnal variation of the electron density, there is a sudden drop in electron density during sunset and a sudden increase during sunrise due to the absence of/sudden onset of effective photodetachment of electrons from negative MSPs. 
	The influence of MSPs on the ion chemistry also affects the neutral background composition through ion-neutral reactions. Especially reactive hydrogen and reactive nitrogen are affected. E.g., there are reduced abundances of reactive hydrogen at 60km altitude and of reactive nitrogen at 90 km. Similar to the ion chemistry, MSP affect the neutral composition mainly during nighttime.},

Coherent wave-particle interactions result in efficient particle acceleration leading to a power-law-like energy distribution function. In the simulation, high-energy particles having large relativistic masses are preferentially accelerated as the turbulence spectrum evolves in time. The main acceleration mechanism is simultaneous relativistic resonance between a particle and two different waves. An analytical expression of maximum attainable energy in such wave-particle interactions is derived.}

By using diffraction gratings out of glass plates with fine scorings across the face, he was able to observe the spectrum of the Sun, announcing in 1862 that he had discovered the lines of hydrogen in the solar spectrum. His most important work, “Recherches sur la Spectre Solaire”, including an atlas of close to a thousand spectral lines, became the standard of spectroscopy for at least a quarter of a century. This article deals with his life as well as his main contributions to the development of several areas of physical science, stressing his pioneer activities in spectroscopy. "

A clay tablet recording numerous celestial observations made by the official astronomers during the 37th year of King Nebuchadnezzar II (568/567 BC) describes an unusual “red glow” in the sky at night; the exact date of this observation corresponds to the night of 12/13 March in 567 BC. The most likely interpretation of the phenomenon is an auroral display. This event occurred several centuries before the first clearly identifiable observation of the aurora from elsewhere in the world, namely China in 193 BC. The Babylonian auroral observation is remarkable in the sense that it is one of a series of carefully recorded astronomical observations, for each of which the year, month and day are known precisely. This observation occurred at a time when the geomagnetic (dipole) latitude of Babylon was about 41°N compared with the present value of 27.5°N, suggesting a higher auroral incidence at Babylon in 567 BC than at present.},

    abstract="The small Japanese scientific satellite Reimei was launched successfully from Baikonur Space Center into a sun-synchronous (noon-midnight meridian) polar orbit at an altitude of ∼630 km on August 23, 2005. Auroral fine structure observations have been performed by the multi-spectral auroral camera (MAC) and electron/ion spectrum analyzers (ESA/ISA) on board Reimei. The MAC is a three channel camera system used to simultaneously observe the temporal dynamics of the auroral fine structure at the wavelengths of 428 nm (N2+ 1NG), 558 nm (O), and 670 nm (N2 1PG). Since its successful launch, Reimei has been operated continuously and produced lots of unique data on the auroral fine structures with the MAC and ESA/ISA. The initial observation data from MAC has shown the temporal dynamics of auroral fine structure, such as the vortex street, appearing in the poleward edge of the auroral oval. The significant differences in the auroral shapes between the MAC channels suggest the existence of different emission processes. Further, the height profiles of the aurora and airglow are clearly seen in the image data in the limb direction. It is expected that the various mechanisms and dynamics of auroral fine structures can be investigated by analyzing the Reimei observation data.",

	abstract="The Earth's auroral electrons produce copious non-thermal radio emissions of various types, including auroral kilometric radiation (AKR), whistler mode auroral hiss, mode conversion radiation such as auroral roar and MF-burst, and possibly HF/VHF emissions. In some cases, mechanisms have been identified and quantitatively described, whereby the energy of the auroral electrons is converted into electromagnetic radiation. In many other cases, the radiation mechanism, or the relative significance of several possible mechanisms, remains uncertain. This review covers fairly comprehensively experimental and theoretical research on types of auroral radiation other than AKR, concentrating on emissions with frequency higher than about 1{\thinspace}kHz and treating only emissions which are unique to the auroral zone. The review covers both ground-based and in-situ observations. It covers a wide range of theoretical approaches, emphasizing those which at present appear most important for producing non-AKR auroral radiations.",

	abstract={We present recent observations from the Hubble Space Telescope -Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aimed at characterizing the auroral emission from the extrasolar planet HD 209458b. We obtained medium-resolution ( R ~ 20,000) far-ultraviolet (1150-1700 Å) spectra at both the Phase 0.25 and Phase 0.75 quadrature positions as well as a stellar baseline measurement at secondary eclipse. This analysis includes a catalog of stellar emission lines and a star-subtracted spectrum of the planet. We present an emission model for planetary H 2 emission, and compare this model to the planetary spectrum. No unambiguously identifiable atomic or molecular features are detected, and upper limits are presented for auroral/dayglow line strengths. An orbital velocity cross-correlation analysis finds a statistically significant (3.8σ) feature at +15(± 20) km s –1 in the rest frame of the planet, at λ1582 Å. This feature is consistent with emission from H 2 B - X (2-9) P(4) (λ rest = 1581.11 Å); however, the physical mechanism required to excite this transition is unclear. We compare limits on relative line strengths seen in the exoplanet spectrum with models of ultraviolet fluorescence to constrain the atmospheric column density of neutral hydrogen between the star and the planetary surface. These results support models of short-period extrasolar giant planets with weak magnetic fields and extended atomic atmospheres.}

Several types of ionospheric echoes are observed, ranging from vertical echoes caused by specular reflection from the horizontally stratified ionosphere to a wide variety of oblique and diffuse echoes. The oblique echoes are believed to arise mainly from ionospheric structures associated with the complex crustal magnetic fields of Mars. Echoes at the electron plasma frequency and the cyclotron period also provide measurements of the local electron density and magnetic field strength.},

    abstract = "Abstract Since the internally-generated magnetic field of Mars is weak, strong coupling is expected between the solar wind, planetary magnetosphere, and planetary ionosphere. However, few previous observational studies of this coupling incorporated data that extended from the solar wind to deep into the ionosphere. Here we use solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere data obtained by the Mars Express spacecraft during March/April 2010 to investigate this coupling. We focus on three case studies, each centered on a pair of ionospheric electron density profiles measured by radio occultations, where the two profiles in each pair were obtained from the same location at an interval of only a few days. We find that high dynamic pressures in the solar wind are associated with compression of the magnetosphere, heating of the magnetosheath, reduction in the vertical extent of the ionosphere, and abrupt changes in electron density at the top of the ionosphere. The first three of these associations are analogous to the behavior of the plasma environment of Venus, but the final one is not. These results reinforce the notion that changes in solar forcing influence the behaviors of all of the tightly coupled regions within the Martian plasma environment. "

These processes can be observed by using diagnostic Thomson scatter radars to probe the pump-enhanced plasma turbulence or by analysing the scattered pump wave directly. Such analyses performed at high and low latitudes (Tromsø, Norway and Arecibo, Puerto Rico) have shown that the physics is extremely complicated and that old theory cannot satisfactorily explain all results. These experiments can shed new light on nonlinear plasma physics in general but may also provide means for diagnosing the near-Earth plasma and for testing theories of astrophysical plasma processes.}

The system implements a spatially diverse sparse array technology and can be deployed and reconfigured easily. Data are captured at the raw voltage level using the system in the field and processed post-experiment. Signal processing for the system is software defined and uses a scalable Cloud computing architecture. The system builds upon the Square Kilometer Array Low Frequency Aperture antenna (SKALA) in combination with custom hardware for data acquisition on a per antenna basis. The instrument uses physically disconnected elements, a high performance direct digitization receiver, hot swap solid state storage, solar and battery power, and wireless control for interconnection. Schedule based operation can also be used in radio quiet locations or to enable minimally attended operation. RAPID is intended for application as both an Astronomical radio telescope and a Geospace imaging radar system. The high degree of mobility a orded by the system enables a wide variety of interferometric configurations and allows deployment of the instrument at locations which are optimal for specific scientific goals.},

A powerful radar can detect the incoherent backscatter from the free electrons in and above the earth's ionosphere. The received signal is spread in frequency by the Doppler shifts associated with the thermal motion of the electrons. On the basis of incoherent backscatter by free electrons a powerful radar, but one whose components are presently within the state of the art, is capable of: 1) measuring electron density and electron temperature as a function of height and time at all levels in the earth's ionosphere and to heights of one or more earth's radii; 2) measuring auroral ionization; 3) detecting transient streams of charged particles coming from outer space; and 4) exploring the existence of a ring current. The instrument is capable of 1) obtaining radar echoes from the sun, Venus, and Mars and possibly from Jupiter and Mercury; and 2) receiving from certain parts of remote space hitherto-undetected sources of radiation at meter wavelengths.},

	abstract = "The recent finding of the solar wind-magnetosphere energy coupling function ε has advanced significantly our understanding of magnetospheric disturbances. It is shown that the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system responds somewhat differently to three different input energy flux levels of ε. As ε increases from &lt; 1017 erg s−1 to &gt; 019 erg s−1, typical responses of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system are: ε &lt; 1017 erg s−1: an enhancement of the Sqp, etc, ε ≈ 1018 erg s−1: substorm onset, 1018 erg s−1 &lt; ε &lt; 1019 erg s−1f: a typical substorm, ε &gt;1019 erg s−1: an abnormal growth of the ring current belt, resulting in a magnetospheric storm. It is stressed that the magnetospheric substorm results as a direct response of the magnetosphere to a rise and fall of ε above ≈ 1018 erg s−1, so that it is not caused by a sudden conversion of magnetic energy accumulated prior to substorm onset. The variety of the development of the main phase of geomagnetic storms is also primarily controlled by ε. "

    abstract = "The paper discusses certain auroral observations and seeks to obtain information in a form which is best suited to the study of physical processes. An attempt is made to express largely descriptive information on the auroral brightness in terms of a quantity π (5577), the number of oxygen green line quanta emitted, in the line of sight, per cm2 column per second. It is concluded that International Brightness Coefficients I, II, III and IV correspond to π (5577) being approximately equal to 2.109, 1.1010, 1.1011 and 5.1012 cm−2 sec−1. An extreme upper limit is estimated as 5.1015 cm−2 sec−1. Measured auroral intensities in ultra-violet vibration bands are compared with intensities obtained from theoretical and laboratory studies. By considering various v progressions (fixed upper state) it is shown that the auroral intensities are in error by an amount which increases systematically as the wavelength is decreased. An empirical correction curve is obtained. Radio and optical evidence on the electron density is discussed and it is concluded that electron densities between 107 and 108 cm−3 occur in bright high latitude aurorae."

    abstract = "The intensity variations of the green oxygen line 5577 Å (1D — 1S) and the first negative nitrogen band 4278 Å (N2+, B2∑u+ − X2∑g+) are measured in rapidly changing aurorae. The mean lifetime of the upper state of the nitrogen band is of the order 10−8 sec, the intensity variations of this band will probably therefore at the same time represent the instantaneous relative excitation rate of the metastable OI 1S-level. The mean lifetime of the metastable OI 1S-level is theoretically calculated to be of the order τ = 0·75 sec (Garstang, 1951). One should therefore expect a time-lag in the intensity curve of the 5577-line relative to the 4278-band. This effect is demonstrated on the records, and the mean lifetime of the OI 1S-level is found to vary between 0·45 and 0·75 sec. The upper value (0·75 sec) confirms the theoretical value found by Garstang (1951), the lower value found indicates that a probability of collisional deactivation of the metastable OI 1S-level of the order 1 sec−1 may appear in the auroral region of the upper atmosphere."

	abstract={It is demonstrated that energetic electrons accelerated in the field-aligned electric wavefield of kinetic Alfvén waves in near Earth space destabilize the ionosphere to secondary Alfvén waves via the well known ionospheric feedback instability. From spacecraft observations and simulations it is shown how this instability may drive waves at wavelengths perpendicular to the geomagnetic field of the order of the electron inertial length (λ e ) and ion gyro-radius (ρ i ). These secondary waves then lead to further electron acceleration and ion trapping. The trapping process results in coherent acceleration up to energies where the ion gyro-radius is equal to half the wavelength of the wave transverse to the geomagnetic field (λ ⊥ ). For sufficiently large wave amplitudes at these scales the orbit of the ions in the wavefield is disrupted and may become stochastic as has been suggested previously from observations by others.}

	abstract = { Abstract The simple auditory reaction time is one of the fastest reaction times and is thought to be rarely less than 100 ms. The current false start criterion in a sprint used by the International Association of Athletics Federations is based on this assumed auditory reaction time of 100 ms. However, there is evidence, both anecdotal and from reflex research, that simple auditory reaction times of less than 100 ms can be achieved. Reaction time in nine athletes performing sprint starts in four conditions was measured using starting blocks instrumented with piezoelectric force transducers in each footplate that were synchronized with the starting signal. Only three conditions were used to calculate reaction times. The pre-motor and pseudo-motor time for two athletes were also measured across 13 muscles using surface electromyography (EMG) synchronized with the rest of the system. Five of the athletes had mean reaction times of less than 100 ms in at least one condition and 20\% of all starts in the first two conditions had a reaction time of less than 100 ms. The results demonstrate that the neuromuscular-physiological component of simple auditory reaction times can be under 85 ms and that EMG latencies can be under 60 ms. }

In this paper we show that the aurora of 4 February 1872 was seen worldwide, and that in the Caribbean, Egypt, Southern Africa, the Indian Ocean, the Indian subcontinent, and China these observations extended as low as 20° magnetic latitude. Observations are also available in the north to as far as the vicinity of the north magnetic pole. This aurora is then comparable to, or greater than, in geographical extent, and in equatorward closeness, to that of 2 September 1859. Both must now be included as the only known members in the class of greatest auroras of the past few hundred years. For the 1859 aurora, however, there is no accepted observation at a lower magnetic latitude than about 20°. By contrast, several observations for the aurora of 4 February 1872 are reported at magnetic latitudes of the order of 10°, and one probable observation at an even lower magnetic latitude of about 3°. This paper presents a survey and discussion of these observations. "

For this purpose, we use a new electron transport model based on a Monte Carlo implementation of the Boltzmann equation and a multi-stream radiative transfer model to calculate the effects of multiple scattering on the intensity field of the 130.4-nm triplet. We show that the consideration of the enhancement of the emergent 130.4-nm to the 135.6-nm intensity by multiple scattering in the optically thick Venus atmosphere increases the auroral 130.4/135.6 ratio by a factor of about 3. We find agreement with the mean 130.4/135.6 ratio observed with PV-OUVS using the typical suprathermal electron energy spectrum reported from \{PV\} in situ measurements showing a characteristic energy of about 14 eV. To account for the average \{OI\} auroral emissions, the required precipitated energy flux is 2×10−3 mW m−2, that is about 30% of the measured suprathermal night-side soft electron spectrum used as a reference. The calculated brightness of the \{CO\} Cameron bands is about twice as large as the weak observed emission, but within the error bars of the observations and the uncertainties of the dissociative excitation cross-section of CO2. The electron transport model, coupled with calculations of excitation processes is also applied to an analysis of the \{FUV\} oxygen day airglow observations made with PV-OUVS and the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) spectrograph. Comparisons indicate that the model accounts for both the disc-averaged intensities observed with the \{HUT\} spectrograph, the limb scans and the 130.4-nm images obtained with PV-OUVS. The relative contribution of resonance scattering of the solar line and photoelectron impact to the excitation of the 130.4-nm triplet depends on the altitude, but is globally dominated by resonance scattering. The intensity of the 130.4-nm dayglow emission does not vary proportionally with the O density in the lower thermosphere, but provides nevertheless a useful tool to remotely probe the atomic oxygen density and its variations.

These features generally occur in regions with significant radial crustal magnetic field. We use a Monte-Carlo electron transport model to investigate the role of the magnetic field on the downward and upward electron fluxes, the brightness and the emitted power of auroral emissions. Simulations based on an ASPERA-3 measured auroral electron precipitation indicate that magnetic mirroring leads to an intensification of the energy flux carried by upward moving electrons– from about 20% in the absence of crustal magnetic field up to 33–78% when magnetic field is included depending on magnetic field topology. Conservation of the particle flux in a flux tube implies that the presence of the B-field does not appreciably modify the emission rate profiles for an initially isotropic pitch angle distribution. However, we find that crustal magnetic field results in increase of the upward electron flux, and, consequently, in reduction of the total auroral brightness for given energy flux of precipitating electrons.

This paper starts with a digression on the pitfalls of a current-based description of a planetary magnetosphere but then proceeds to characterize the magnetospheres of Jupiter, Earth, and to some extent Saturn by the currents that flow within them. Emphasis is placed on the field-aligned currents that couple the equatorial magnetospheres to the ionospheres and the conditions that call for the development of field-aligned electric fields.",

Interpretation of this data indicates that density and temperature in this region are much higher than previously supposed. Various energy sources which may account for this variable heating and swelling of the atmosphere are considered. An explanation is given in terms of variable heating due to electric currents in the upper atmosphere induced by magnetic fields frozen in the corpuscular streams. It is supposed that this mechanism can accelerate atmospheric ions and electrons."

As the rotational structure of the bands is not resolved, it is not absolutely certain that the temperature anomaly is real, but known features in the auroral spectrum would not produce the effect through blending. Fluorescence in the 0-0 band provides a possible but improbable explanation. Another alternative to explain the data is excitation of O2 by energy transfer from O (1D) (upper term of the red lines) followed by vibrational deactivation. In the latter case the relative intensities of the O2 bands and the [OI] red lines gives an indication of the rate coefficients for the relevant reactions, which are then used to predict the deactivation probability for O (1D) as a function of height. The reactions discussed give a satisfactory explanation of the absence in the airglow of atmospheric O2 bands from vibrational levels v′ ⩾ 1, and predict virtually complete suppression of the [OI] red lines at 100 km in the airglow. The airglow O2 emission gives Trot(0–1) = 183°K,"

For this reception experiment, Marconi used a kite supported wire aerial, an untuned receiver, a detector of uncertain performance and a telephone receiver. The signals, if heard, would have traveled a distance of 3500 kilometres. Even at the time of the experiment there were those who said, indeed there are some who still say, that he misled himself and the world into believing that atmospheric noise crackling was in fact the Morse code letter "S". A little later, in February 1902, when Marconi was returning to North America on the SS Philadelphia, using a tuned ship-borne antenna, he received signals using his filings coherer from the same sender up to distances of 1120 km by day and 2500 km by night. Even these distances are rather remarkable considering the receiving apparatus he used. This paper revisits that first transatlantic experiment and concludes that it is difficult to believe that signals could have been heard on Signal Hill.},

Kennelly and Heaviside suggested that the waves were reflected by the upper atmosphere, which they believed to be highly conducting simply because it was at low pressure; the reason for that belief is discussed. Published information about the circuits at the sender and at the receiver in Newfoundland, and in a ship on which the signals were also received, is used in an attempt to deduce the wavelength and the bandwidth of the radiation. Present-day knowledge of the ionosphere is then used to inquire under what conditions the signal could have been received in Newfoundland, and a number of possibilities are listed. All require that the receiver in Newfoundland must have been much more sensitive than that on the ship.},

    abstract={The object of the paper is to survey the existing knowledge of horizontal movements in the ionosphere as obtained by radio methods. After a brief introduction the various methods and associated results are described under the following main headings: Reflected radio waves observed at closely spaced points; Observations of movements of large scale irregularities in the F region; Observations of waves from radio stars; Observations of waves reflected from meteor trails; Observations of waves reflected from the sporadic-E layer. The most detailed discussion is accorded to the first of these methods, with which the authors have been personally associated. The results obtained at Cambridge, England, by this method are compared with the results obtained by other workers using this and the other methods in different parts of the world. The following conclusions are reached: At all levels in the ionosphere systematic as well as irregular horizontal movements are present. Typical velocities are of the order of 80 m/sec; there is a tendency for the velocity to increase with height. The systematic movements have the form of regular diurnal and seasonal variations and show considerable consistency between observations made in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. At heights around 100 km the semi-diurnal components of the velocity, as determined by Fourier analysis, are found to represent a uniformly rotating velocity vector; the direction of the rotation is clockwise in the Northern hemisphere and anti-clockwise in the Southern hemisphere. This is the type of movement predicted by the theory of atmospheric oscillations, though the phase of the rotation is not that expected theoretically. At times of magnetic disturbance the velocities of the horizontal movements are increased, and this phenomenon becomes more marked with increasing height in the atmosphere. At 300 km velocities as high as 1000 m/sec have been recorded during magnetic storms. The report ends with a brief summary of observations by non-radio methods.}

The network has now grown so that the fields of view of its 18 radars cover the majority of the northern and southern hemisphere polar ionospheres. SuperDARN has been successful in addressing a wide range of scientific questions concerning processes in the magnetosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, as well as general plasma physics questions. We commence this paper with a historical introduction to SuperDARN. Following this, we review the science performed by SuperDARN over the last 10 years covering the areas of ionospheric convection, field-aligned currents, magnetic reconnection, substorms, MHD waves, the neutral atmosphere, and E-region ionospheric irregularities. In addition, we provide an up-to-date description of the current network, as well as the analysis techniques available for use with the data from the radars. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the future of SuperDARN, its expansion, and new science opportunities.",

	abstract={We present a feasibility study for a high-frame-rate Short-baseline auroral tomographic imaging system useful for estimating parametric variations in the precipitating electron number flux spectrum of dynamic auroral events. Of particular interest are auroral substorms, which are characterized by spatial variations of order 100 m and temporal variations of order 10 ms. These scales are thought to be produced by dispersive Alfvén waves in the near-Earth magnetosphere. The auroral tomography system characterized in this paper reconstructs the auroral volume emission rate, to estimate the characteristic energy and location in the direction perpendicular to the geomagnetic field of peak electron precipitation flux, using a distributed network of precisely synchronized ground-based cameras. As the observing baseline decreases, the tomographic inverse problem becomes highly ill-conditioned; as the sampling rate increases, the signal-to-noise ratio degrades and synchronization requirements become increasingly critical. Our approach to these challenges uses a physics-based auroral model to regularize the poorly observed vertical dimension. Specifically, the vertical dimension is expanded in a low-dimensional basis, consisting of eigenprofiles computed over the range of expected energies in the precipitating electron flux, while the horizontal dimension retains a standard orthogonal pixel basis. Simulation results show typical characteristic energy estimation error less than 30% for a 3-km baseline achievable within the confines of the Poker Flat Research Range, using GPS-synchronized electron-multiplying charge-coupled device cameras with broadband BG3 optical filters that pass prompt auroral emissions.},

  Abstract                 = {The IMAGE satellite carries three FUV imagers observing N2 LBH, O I 1356 Å, and HI Lyman α emissions in the polar aurora. These simultaneous observations are used to characterize the precipitating electron and proton energy fluxes. The proton energy flux is derived from the Lyman α measurements on the basis of efficiency curves calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation of the proton aurora. The resulting proton contribution to the N2 LBH and O I 1356 Å emissions is calculated and subtracted to obtain the electron contribution in the other two channels. These two quantities are used to determine the precipitating electron average energy and energy flux. The proton and electron energy fluxes are integrated over the hemisphere to obtain the rate of auroral energy dissipation (hemispheric power) carried by the protons and electrons separately. The time development of the proton and electron aurora during four winter time events is examined. Although the onsets of the proton and electron aurora coincide in time and space, the time of the peak of energy dissipation and the recovery time are often found to differ. The fractional energy flux carried by the protons is highest during quiet periods and reaches a minimum during the most active phase of the substorms. This result is in agreement with the dependence of the fractional proton hemispheric power on magnetic activity measured by NOAA 15. The hemispheric power deduced from the FUV images is compared to the NOAA-deduced values and found to be in reasonable agreement. Sources of uncertainties in the determination of the hemispheric power are discussed on the basis of several sensitivity tests. In particular, it is found that the most critical factor is the assumption made on the energy of the auroral protons if this energy is <25 keV.},

	pages="687--692",
	abstract="The aurora on Ganymede results from the interaction of Jovian plasma disk electrons with Ganymede's tenuous atmosphere. At the same time, the electrons surrounding Ganymede have energy insufficient for the excitation of emission in the observed lines. They can acquire the necessary acceleration through various processes, such as reconnection of Ganymede's intrinsic magnetic field with the Jovian magnetic field in the upstream and downstream regions. The generation mechanism of a field-aligned potential drop on auroral field lines is considered. The lack of charge carriers required for the generation of the necessary current closing the Alfv{\'e}n-wing field-aligned currents is shown to be responsible for the formation of an accelerating potential and the acceleration of thermal magnetospheric electrons. The total current in the circuit is determined by the calculated cross-field potential drop applied to Ganymede and by the Pedersen conductivity of Ganymede's ionosphere.",

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a short overview of our current understanding of the upper atmosphere/ionosphere of Mars including the escaping neutral atmosphere to space that plays a key role in the current state of the Mars upper atmosphere. The proper definition of the word ``aeronomy'' relates to the upper atmosphere where ionization is important. Currently there is a paucity of measurements of the internal physical structure of the Martian upper atmosphere/ionosphere. Much that we know has been deduced from theoretical models that predict many more things than thus far measured. The newest Mars orbital missions, the US MAVEN and Indian MOM missions, just beginning their science analyses, will provide the measurements needed to fully characterize the aeronomy of Mars.},

	year="2011",
	volume="32",
	number="1",
	pages="1--70",
	abstract="The paper reviews the main advantages and limitations of the kinetic exospheric and fluid models of the solar wind (SW). The general theoretical background is outlined: the Boltzmann and Fokker--Planck equations, the Liouville and Vlasov equations, the plasma transport equations derived from an ``equation of change''. The paper provides a brief history of the solar wind modeling. It discusses the hydrostatic model imagined by Chapman, the first supersonic hydrodynamic models published by Parker and the first generation subsonic kinetic model proposed by Chamberlain. It is shown that a correct estimation of the electric field, as in the second generation kinetic exospheric models developed by Lemaire and Scherer, provides a supersonic expansion of the corona, reconciling the hydrodynamic and the kinetic approach. The modern developments are also reviewed emphasizing the characteristics of several generations of kinetic exospheric and multi-fluid models. The third generation kinetic exospheric models consider kappa velocity distribution function (VDF) instead of a Maxwellian at the exobase and in addition they treat a non-monotonic variation of the electric potential with the radial distance; the fourth generation exospheric models include Coulomb collisions based on the Fokker--Planck collision term. Multi-fluid models of the solar wind provide a coarse grained description of the system and reproduce with success the spatio-temporal variation of SW macroscopic properties (density, bulk velocity). The main categories of multi-fluid SW models are reviewed: the 5-moment, or Euler, models, originally proposed by Parker to describe the supersonic SW expansion; the 8-moment and 16-moment fluid models, the gyrotropic approach with improved collision terms as well as the gyrotropic models based on observed VDFs. The outstanding problem of collisions, including the long range Coulomb encounters, is also discussed, both in the kinetic and multi-fluid context. Although for decades the two approaches have been seen as opposed, in this paper we emphasize their complementarity. The review of the kinetic and fluid models of the solar wind contributes also to a better evaluation of the open questions still existent in SW modeling and suggests possible future developments.",

abstract={CERN's tape-based archive system has collected over 70 Petabytes of data during the first run of the LHC. The Long Shutdown is being used for migrating the complete 100 Petabytes data archive to higher-density tape media. During LHC Run 2, the archive will have to cope with yearly growth rates of up to 40-50 Petabytes. In this contribution, we describe the scalable setup for coping with the storage and long-term archival of such massive data amounts. We also review the challenges resulting and mechanisms devised for measuring and enhancing availability and reliability, as well as ensuring the long-term integrity and bit-level preservation of the complete data repository. The procedures and tools for the proactive and efficient operation of the tape infrastructure are described, including the features developed for automated problem detection, identification and notification. Finally, we present an outlook in terms of future capacity requirements growth and how it matches the expected tape technology evolution.}

For tomography from very few angles, the NP approach provides some distinct advantages over standard basis expansions. The NP solution requires no prior assumption and as such embeds into the solution the natural spatial resolution supported by the data. For the uniquely constrained CIT geometry, however, NP estimated fields will contain significant negative values. We propose a method of improving the NP estimates by enforcing positivity through an entropy regularization algorithm. These techniques are demonstrated in an example},

	abstract = "Most approaches for estimating optical flow assume that, within a finite image region, only a single motion is present. This single motion assumption is violated in common situations involving transparency, depth discontinuities, independently moving objects, shadows, and specular reflections. To robustly estimate optical flow, the single motion assumption must be relaxed. This paper presents a framework based onrobust estimation that addresses violations of the brightness constancy and spatial smoothness assumptions caused by multiple motions. We show how the robust estimation framework can be applied to standard formulations of the optical flow problem thus reducing their sensitivity to violations of their underlying assumptions. The approach has been applied to three standard techniques for recovering optical flow: area-based regression, correlation, and regularization with motion discontinuities. This paper focuses on the recovery of multiple parametric motion models within a region, as well as the recovery of piecewise-smooth flow fields, and provides examples with natural and synthetic image sequences."

	abstract = "Abstract We report rapid motion of pulsating auroras associated with so called ​3 ± 1 Hz modulations embedded in the main pulsations. During the pulsation \{ON\} phase, repetitive expansions are often observed around the edges of pulsating patches. Some events show a few detached expansions traveling away from the main deformed pulsating patch. Approximately 80% of all expansion speeds were found to be less than 70 km s−1 at ionospheric altitudes, which is less than the projected Alfvén speed from the magnetospheric equator to the ionosphere. The rapid motions with speeds of tens of km s−1 are unlikely to be explained by obliquely propagating chorus elements, which are known to cause the 3 ± 1 Hz modulation, because the perpendicular speed of the oblique chorus waves is higher than the Alfvén speed. We discuss the slow-mode Alfvén wave as a candidate modulation source to generate the rapid motions. A few non-repetitive expansion events with a speed of more than 150 km s−1 also appear at the onset of the \{ON\} phase. These non-repetitive expanding motions are characterized by a long displacement compared to the repetitive expanding motions. The differences in the expansion speeds indicate different formation mechanisms of the patch motions. "

Cutting-edge ground-based optical observations using scientific complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (sCMOS) cameras recently enabled us to observe the fine-scale morphology of bright aurora at magnetic zenith for a variety of rapidly varying features for long uninterrupted periods. We report two interesting examples of combinations of fine-scale rapidly varying auroral features as observed by the sCMOS cameras installed at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), Alaska, in February 2014. The first example shows that flickering rays and pulsating modulation simultaneously appeared at the middle of a surge in the pre-midnight sector. The second example shows localized flickering aurora associated with growing eddies at the poleward edge of an arc in the midnight sector.",

The 1957 census was based on human visual observations of cave emergence flights that were subject to potentially high errors. The recent census was produced using an accurate, reproducible counting method and based on complete temporal records of colony emergences. Analysis of emergence flights from dusk through darkness also revealed patterns in group behavior that would be difficult to capture without thermal infrared technology. Flow patterns of bats during emergence flights exhibited characteristic single, double, or triple episodes, with the peak flow during the 1st episode. A consistent rhythmic pattern of flow episodes and pauses was revealed across colonies and was independent of emergence tempo.},

We do not assume any prior knowledge about the numbers involved, and the objects may appear or disappear anywhere in the image frame and at any time in the sequence. Our approach combines the techniques of multitarget track initiation, recursive Bayesian tracking, clutter modeling, event analysis, and multiple hypothesis filtering. The original multiple hypothesis filter addresses an NP-hard problem and is thus not practical. We propose two cluster-based data association approaches that are linear in the number of detections and tracked objects. We applied the method to track wildlife in infrared video. We have successfully tracked hundreds of thousands of bats which were flying at high speeds and in dense formations.},

Science instruments onboard a modern deep-space spacecraft can acquire much more data that can be downloaded to Earth, given the limited communication bandwidth. Onboard data analysis offers a means of compressing the huge amounts of data collected and downloading only the most valuable subset of the collected data. In this paper, we describe algorithms for detecting dust devils and clouds onboard Mars rovers, and summarize the results. These algorithms achieve the accuracy required by planetary scientists, as well as the runtime, CPU, memory, and bandwidth constraints set by the engineering mission parameters. The detectors have been uploaded to the Mars Exploration Rovers, and currently are operational. These detectors are the first onboard science analysis processes on Mars.",

	abstract="Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are an important aspect of coronal physics and a potentially significant contributor to perturbations of the solar wind, such as its mass flux. Sufficient data on CMEs are now available to permit study of their longer-term occurrence patterns. Here we present the results of a study of CME occurrence rates over more than a complete 11-year solar sunspot cycle and a comparison of these rates with those of other activity related to CMEs and with the solar wind particle flux at 1 AU. The study includes an evaluation of corrections to the CME rates, which include instrument duty cycles, visibility functions, mass detection thresholds, and geometrical considerations. The main results are as follows: (1) The frequency of occurrence of CMEs tends to track the solar activity cycle in both amplitude and phase; (2) the CME rates from different instruments, when corrected for both duty cycles and visibility functions, are reasonably consistent; (3) considering only longer-term averages, no one class of solar activity is better correlated with CME rate than any other; (4) the ratio of the annualized CME to solar wind mass flux tends to track the solar cycle; and (5) near solar maximum, CMEs can provide a significant fraction (i.e., \&\#8776; 15\%) of the average mass flux to the near-ecliptic solar wind.",

	abstract={In this paper we introduce a novel method to detect and localize abnormal behaviors in crowd videos using Social Force model. For this purpose, a grid of particles is placed over the image and it is advected with the space-time average of optical flow. By treating the moving particles as individuals, their interaction forces are estimated using social force model. The interaction force is then mapped into the image plane to obtain Force Flow for every pixel in every frame. Randomly selected spatio-temporal volumes of Force Flow are used to model the normal behavior of the crowd. We classify frames as normal and abnormal by using a bag of words approach. The regions of anomalies in the abnormal frames are localized using interaction forces. The experiments are conducted on a publicly available dataset from University of Minnesota for escape panic scenarios and a challenging dataset of crowd videos taken from the web. The experiments show that the proposed method captures the dynamics of the crowd behavior successfully. In addition, we have shown that the social force approach outperforms similar approaches based on pure optical flow.},

Specific topics in early vision and their regularization are then analyzed rigorously, characterizing existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions. A fundamental difficulty that arises in almost every vision problem is scale, that is, the resolution at which to operate. Methods that have been proposed to deal with the problem include scale-space techniques that consider the behavior of the result across a continuum of scales. From the point of view of regulation theory, the concept of scale is related quite directly to the regularization parameter λ. It suggested that methods used to obtained the optimal value of λ may provide, either directly or after suitable modification, the optimal scale associated with the specific instance of certain problems},

The emphasis of the present work is on identifying apparent auroral feature motion in both the B|| and B⊥ dimensions in order to uncover the physical model responsible for wave spreading under the given electron beam excitation. The auroral B|| dimension is known to experience a change in shape and peak optical emission for given electron beam energies, and forward models have been previously established for these phenomena. The transverse proper motion of auroral features is related to spreading of energy in the B⊥ direction. Several theories have been advanced to explain the auroral transverse proper motion, but previous observational efforts have been limited to temporal scales on the order of a second. Our new observational facility is capable of simultaneously resolving features to the decameter scale spatially and millisecond scale temporally-a capability not available until now thanks to recent advances in Electron-Multiplying Charge Coupled Device (EMCCD) technology that are triggerable with sub-millisecond accuracy from GPS-disciplined trigger sources. We can thereby combine multiple simultaneous 2D optical observations with arbitrarily physical separation to take tightly time-synchronized observations of extremely faint optical phenomena for tomographic inversion.},

	abstract = "Abstract Because of its fast image acquisition and the rich diagnostic information it provides, computed tomography (CT) has gradually become a popular imaging modality among clinicians. Because \{CT\} scanners emit x-rays, the increased use of \{CT\} in clinical applications inevitably leads to increased medical radiation dose to the population. Because of the well-known cancer-inducing effects of high dose x-ray radiation, this increased dose has caused concerns among policy makers and general public that \{CT\} patients may be at a higher risk of developing cancer. Over the years, \{CT\} manufacturers have developed a variety of strategies to address this issue, the latest being a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm. \{MBIR\} is an advanced \{CT\} algorithm that incorporates modeling of several key parameters that were omitted in earlier algorithms to reduce computational requirement and speed up scans. This review article examines the latest literature in the clinical \{CT\} field and discusses the general principles of MBIR, its dose and noise reduction potentials, its imaging characteristics, and its limitations. \{MBIR\} algorithm and its application in today's \{CT\} imaging will greatly reduce the radiation dose to patients and improve image quality for clinicians.

	abstract={We have built a reliable and robust system that takes as input an astronomical image, and returns as output the pointing, scale, and orientation of that image (the astrometric calibration or World Coordinate System information). The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing—not even the image scale—is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a null hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B catalog and designed for uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is >99.9% for contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B catalog; augmentation with indices built from the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog brings the completeness to 100% with no false positives. We are using this system to generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific investigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it possible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary provenance.}

    abstract="While different optical flow techniques continue to appear, there has been a lack of quantitative evaluation of existing methods. For a common set of real and synthetic image sequences, we report the results of a number of regularly cited optical flow techniques, including instances of differential, matching, energy-based, and phase-based methods. Our comparisons are primarily empirical, and concentrate on the accuracy, reliability, and density of the velocity measurements; they show that performance can differ significantly among the techniques we implemented.",
